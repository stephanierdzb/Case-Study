        <p> Users want to donate to organizations and foundations they trust. Unfortunately, most people don’t know about this amazing organization or what they do to help the Military Community. There donation goal is only at 42% and I belive this is because of their lack of foundation, mission, goals and purpost on their homepage. These objectives should be easily found. </

          When creating the first survey I focused on if the user had any previous knowledge of this organization. We also wanted to learn if the message was clear in their homepage, and how easy/ahd it was to use the desktop and mobile versions. 
          After our first survey results were analyzed we knew we had to make a few iterations. For one, alot of the survey was not Quantative Data, but more written and personal opinions. Our second iteration included more upfront questions, yes/no answers and ratings. <br>

<h2 class="section-title-heading">Wireframe</h2> <br>
<p> These are my original Low-Fidelity Wireframs<br>
I really wanted the mission statement to be one of the first things the user sees, and by incorporating a photo with the mission statement, I thought this would give it more legitimacy and value. 
<br> For the programs I wanted to be able to read a small description of each one, and have a button to learn more about each one of them. <br>
I wanted to add a space dedicated to the News Articles they are featured in, again to establish that trust, and to also add a testimonials our users can see that they do give all these awards. 
<br> 
Lastly, I wanted to lock in that trust by having a place for their awards. <br>
